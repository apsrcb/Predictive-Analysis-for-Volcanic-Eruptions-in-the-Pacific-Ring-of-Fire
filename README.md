# Predictive Analysis for Volcanic Eruptions in the Pacific Ring of Fire

## Project Description

This project aims to predict earthquakes and visualize earthquake data using machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques. The goal is to build predictive models that can classify earthquakes based on their magnitude and provide insights into earthquake patterns and distributions across the world.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/rithikabadam/Predictive-Analysis-for-Volcanic-Eruptions-in-the-Pacific-Ring-of-Fire]

2. Install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Machine Learning
The data is preprocessed, relevant features are selected, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Four machine learning models are trained and their accuracy is evaluated:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Random Forest classifier
- Gaussian Process classifier
Test data is loaded from the CSV file philippinestest.csv, and earthquake predictions are made using the trained Random Forest classifier. The results are displayed for each data point, showing whether eruption activity is detected or not.
